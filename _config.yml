  As a spatial statistician and policy researcher by training, I bring deep analytic expertise in geographic data analysis, policy evaluation, and 
  measure development to my work. For the past 5 years, I've led the design and implementation of quantitative analyses to examine federal child 
  nutrition programs, child welfare service provision, and unintended and teen pregnancy prevention programs for federal and foundation clients.
  In addition to my professional research, I am currently pursuing my PhD in Geography at Arizona State University where I seek to advance
  the development of a Spatial Policy that brings an explicitly geographic approach to public policy research. My dissertation aims to
  offer a pathway to shift from simply identifying "what works" to knowing "what works where" to support improved evidence-based policy making.
